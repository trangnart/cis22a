# 2.12 LAB: Input and formatted output: House real estate summary
Sites like Zillow get input about house prices from a database and provide nice summaries for readers. Write a program with two inputs, current price and last month's price (both integers). Then, output a summary listing the price, the change since last month, and the estimated monthly mortgage computed as (currentPrice * 0.051) / 12 (Note: Output directly. Do not store in a variable.).

Ex: If the input is:
```
200000 210000
```
the output is:
```
This house is $200000. The change is $-10000 since last month.
The estimated monthly mortgage is $850.
```
Note: Getting the precise spacing, punctuation, and newlines exactly right is a key point of this assignment. Such precision is an important part of programming.
