# 3.26 LAB: Using math functions
Given three floating-point numbers `x`, `y`, and `z`, output `x` to the power of `z`, `x` to the power of (`y` to the power of `z`), the absolute value of `y`, and the square root of (`xy` to the power of `z`).

Ex: If the input is:
```
5.0 6.5 3.2
```
the output is:
```
172.466 1.29951e+279 6.5 262.43
```
