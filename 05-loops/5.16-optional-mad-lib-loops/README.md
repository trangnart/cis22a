# 5.16 LAB: Mad Lib - loops

Mad Libs are activities that have a person provide various words, which are then used to complete a short story in unexpected (and hopefully funny) ways.

Write a program that takes a string and integer as input, and outputs a sentence using those items as below. The program repeats until the input is quit 0.

Ex: If the input is:
```
apples 5
shoes 2
quit 0
```
the output is:
```
Eating 5 apples a day keeps the doctor away.
Eating 2 shoes a day keeps the doctor away.
```
Note: This is a lab from a previous chapter that now requires the use of a loop.
