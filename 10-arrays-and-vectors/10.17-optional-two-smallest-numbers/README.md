# 10.17 LAB: Two smallest numbers
Write a program that reads a list of integers, and outputs the two smallest integers in the list, in ascending order. The input begins with an integer indicating the number of integers that follow.

Ex: If the input is:

```
5 10 5 3 21 2
```
the output is:

```
2 3
```
You can assume that the list of integers will have at least 2 values.

To achieve the above, first read the integers into a vector.

> Hint: Make sure to initialize the second smallest and smallest integers properly.
