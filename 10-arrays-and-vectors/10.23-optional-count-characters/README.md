Write a program whose input is a character and a string, and whose output indicates the number of times the character appears in the string.

Ex: If the input is:

```
n Monday
```
the output is:

```
1
```
Ex: If the input is:

```
z Today is Monday
```
the output is:

```
0
```
Ex: If the input is:

```
n It's a sunny day
```
the output is:

```
2
```
Case matters. `n` is different than `N`.

Ex: If the input is:

```
n Nobody
```
the output is:

```
0
```
Your program must define and call the following function that returns the number of times the input character appears in the input string.
`int CountCharacters(char userChar, string userString)`

> Note: This is a lab from a previous chapter that now requires the use of a function.
