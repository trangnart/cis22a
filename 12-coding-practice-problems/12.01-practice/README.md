# 12.1 Coding practice problems overview

## Why use Coding Practice Problems?
Research shows that repeated practice moves knowledge into the long-term region of the brain, making tasks easier (compare the ease of driving now vs. when you first learned) and enabling new learning on top of that knowledge.

This material is designed for students to practice the most fundamental programming concepts via short coding problems. The auto-grading provides immediate feedback of correctness, so students can instantly find/fix bugs.

Many problems were adapted from exam questions at various universities, so practicing may improve exam performance. Problems focus on core skills, so practicing may improve a student's ability to efficiently complete programming assignments. Students preparing for job interviews may also find the practice helps them answer common interview coding questions.

## Hints and solutions
Many problems includes hints at the bottom of the specification. Students are encouraged to NOT read those hints initially. If stuck on a problem, students might read just the NEXT hint, not all the hints. Trying to figure out how to solve the problems is working your brain in the necessary ways; reading how someone else solved the problem is a different skill. It's like trying to solve a riddle versus being told the answer to a riddle.

Each problem includes a solution by an experienced programmer. Programming is like an essay answering a question: Numerous correct answers exist. Comparing your solution to experienced programmer may yield insights. As with hints, students are encouraged NOT to view the solution until done, or if stuck.

Most solutions have ending comments that describe key decisions, common issues, etc.

## Difficulty and time
An estimate of each problem's difficulty is indicated using asterisks in the problem's title (`*`, `**`, or `***`). These are based on a person who is just learning that topic. Ex: When learning branches, a problem may be of medium difficulty and thus have two asterisks, but by the time a student has learned loops, that branching problem may be easy.

Each problem is estimated to take between 5 minutes (one asterisk) to perhaps 20 minutes (three asterisks) for a student. Sometimes a problem will take longer, especially in the presence of bugs. That is perfectly normal. Just remember, every time you get stuck on a programming problem, you become a slightly stronger programmer. It's like lifting weights: Hurts, but strengthens.

## Now start practicing!
Below is an example problem, with hints, results from automated grading of a student's, and the solution (with explanation notes) that a student can view at any time. The student's submission is close, but is failing some tests; from those test cases, the student realizes he/she isn't handling exclamation points correctly, so goes back and fixes his/her submission and submits again (as many times as desired).

## Example problem, to get you warmed up
Given an input integer, output two times that integer. End with newline. (NOTE: Nearly every problem expects the student to follow the good practice of always ending output with a newline, so the newline won't be explicitly stated). Do not prompt the user to enter the integer; just read the integer. Ex: If the input is 3, the output should be 6.

## Hints
* A series of hints would normally appear here. This problem is very simple so not many hints appear, and they are very basic.
* Read the integer into a variable using `cin`, as in: `cin >> userInt`; Then, use cout to output 2 times that integer.
* Don't forget to end with newline.
* When using "Develop" mode, remember to pre-enter the needed input values. Otherwise you may get weird behavior when running.
