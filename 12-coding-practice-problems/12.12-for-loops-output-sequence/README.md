# 12.12 PRACTICE: Loops (for)*: Output sequence
![Easy]

Given an integer `n`,
write a for loop that outputs the numbers from `-n` to `+n`.
Assume `n` is nonnegative.
End the sequence with a newline.

## Input/Output
```
Enter an integer:
2
Sequence: -2 -1 0 1 2
```

If `n. is negative, treat as the absolute value.
So `n` of `-2` is the same as `n` of `2`.

Hint: Use an `if` statement before the for loop,
to compute the absolute value of `n`.

## Input/Output
```
Enter an integer:
-2
Sequence: -2 -1 0 1 2
```
