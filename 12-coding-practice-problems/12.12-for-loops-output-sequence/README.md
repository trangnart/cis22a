# 12.12 PRACTICE: Loops (for)*: Output sequence
(1) Given an integer n, write a for loop that outputs the numbers from -n to +n. Assume n is nonnegative. End the sequence with a newline.

```
Enter an integer:
2
Sequence: -2 -1 0 1 2
```
(2) If n is negative, treat as the absolute value. So n of -2 is the same as n of 2. Hint: Use an if statement before the for loop, to compute the absolute value of n.

```
Enter an integer:
-2
Sequence: -2 -1 0 1 2
```
