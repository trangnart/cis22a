# 12.13 PRACTICE: Loops (for)*: Output evens
(1) Given positive integer n, write a for loop that outputs the even numbers from n down to 0. If n is odd, start with the next lower even number. Hint: Use an if statement and the % operator to detect if n is odd, decrementing n if so.

```
Enter an integer:
7
Sequence: 6 4 2 0
```
(2) If n is negative, output 0. Hint: Use an if statement to check if n is negative. If so, just set n = 0.

```
Enter an integer:
-1
Sequence: 0
```
