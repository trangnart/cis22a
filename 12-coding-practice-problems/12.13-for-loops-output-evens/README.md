# 12.13 PRACTICE: Loops (for)*: Output evens
![Easy]

Given positive integer `n`,
write a for loop that outputs the even numbers from `n` down to `0`.
If `n` is odd, start with the next lower even number.

_Hint_: Use an if statement and the `%` operator to detect if `n` is odd, decrementing `n` if so.

## Input/Output
```
Enter an integer:
7
Sequence: 6 4 2 0
```

If `n` is negative, output `0`.

_Hint_: Use an `if` statement to check if `n` is negative.
If so, just set `n = 0`.

```
Enter an integer:
-1
Sequence: 0
```
