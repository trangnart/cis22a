# 11.18 PRACTICE: Loops**: Removing leading/trailing whitespace
![Difficult]

Users may type or copy-paste in a text box of a web form,
perhaps a name like `Joe Smith`.
The user sometimes has whitespace before or after the text,
like ` Joe Smith `.

A program typically strips such leading and trailing whitespace.
Given a string, create a new string that lacks any leading or trailing spaces.
Given ` Joe Smith `, the new string should be `Joe Smith`.
Be sure to handle the case of the user entering only whitespace,
or entering nothing, which each should yield an empty string `""`.

## Hints
* Initially, try to find the index of the first non-space character.
Set the index to `0`, then use a while loop to check each character.
* Your while loop expression should first check that the index is valid for the size of the string.
* The `size()` function of a string returns an unsigned int, so declare your index variable as an unsigned int so you can compare without a compiler warning.
* Next, try to find the index of the last non-space character.
Use a different index variable.
You while loop expression should first check that it is greater-than-or-equal to `0` to ensure it is valid.
* Once you know the first and last non-space characters, you can use a for loop to copy those characters to the new string.
* After the first while loop, be sure to check if any non-space character was found (by checking if the index is less than the string's last element).
If no non-space character was found, just return.
