# 12.19 PRACTICE: Loops*: Password requirements
![Easy]

Websites commonly require a password that satisfies several requirements.
Write a program that checks if an input string satisfies the following
(error message is shown for each)

* At least 8 characters (Too short)
* At least one letter (Missing letter)
* At least one number (Missing number)
* At least one of these special characters: `!`, `#`, `%` (Missing special)

Output `OK`, or all related error messages (in above order).

## Input
```
Hello
```

## Output
```
Too short
Missing number
Missing special
```

## Hints
* Declare a boolean variable for each requirement.
* Use a for loop to visit each character,
setting the corresponding boolean to `true` if satisfied
(length is done differently though).
* Use functions in the `cctype` library
(must include the library first) to detect if a character is a letter or a number.
