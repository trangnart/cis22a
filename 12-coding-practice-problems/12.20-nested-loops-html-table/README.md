# 12.20 PRACTICE: Loops (nested)**: HTML table
![Difficult]

HTML is the language of web pages.
Items start and end with tags.
A table starts with `<table>` and ends with `</table>`.
In a table, a row starts with `<tr>` and ends with `</tr>`.
In a row, a column starts with `<td>` and ends with `</td>`.
Given two integers for rows and columns, generate an appropriately sized html table.
Place the character `c` in each table cell.

## Input
```
2 3
```

## Output
```
<table>
<tr> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> </tr>
</table>
```
