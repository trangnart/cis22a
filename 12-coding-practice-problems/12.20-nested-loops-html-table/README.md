HTML is the language of web pages. Items start and end with tags. A table starts with `<table>` and ends with `</table>`. In a table, a row starts with `<tr>` and ends with `</tr>`. In a row, a column starts with `<td>` and ends with `</td>`. Given two integers for rows and columns, generate an appropriately sized html table. Place the character c in each table cell. If the input is 2 3, the output is:

```
<table>
<tr> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> </tr>
</table>
```
