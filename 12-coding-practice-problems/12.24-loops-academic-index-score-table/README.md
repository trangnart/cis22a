# 12.24 PRACTICE: Loops**: Academic index score table
![Difficult]

Many universities calculate a weighted sum of an applicant's high school GPA and standardized test scores,
whose value (called an Academic Index Score or AIS)
must exceed a minimum threshold to be considered for admission.

## Example
```
AIS = 2.5 * (GPA / 4.0) * 100 + (test_score / 1600) * 100
```
must be at least 270.

Write a program that, given a threshold, prints a table indicating the minimum GPA / test score combinations that meet the threshold.
Use doubles for all values.
Each row is GPA then test score.
GPA should range from 3.0 to 4.0 in increments of 0.1.

## Hints
* Do some algebra first to solve the above equation for `test_score`.
* Write a for loop that iterates `11` times, for 3.0 to 4.0 in 0.1 increments. For each iteration, print the row GPA, then calculate the `test_score` using the equation you created.
* Be careful to avoid integer division, which yields a different result than floating-point division.
