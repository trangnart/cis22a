# 12.33 PRACTICE: Vectors**: Mode
![Difficult]

The "mode" is a statistical summary of data (as are min, max, and average) representing the most commonly-occurring value.
Given 10 integers ranging from `0` to `99`,
output the mode and its frequency.

## Input/Output
Input | Output
--- | ---
`1 1 1 1 2 2 9 8 7 6` | `1 4`

If any integer is outside `0-99`, output an error.

## Input
```
105
```

## Output
```
Invalid input: 105 is not in 0-99
```

## Hints
* Knowing that integers are in `0-99` enables creating a vector with 100 elements to count the occurrences of each value.
* Traverse the userValues vector and keep count by incrementing the appropriate element in a counts vector.
If the input is `27`, then increment element `27`'s value.
* While traversing userValues, check for an integer outside the range.
If found, print the error message, and immediately return.
* After done counting, use another loop to traverse the counts vector and find the max.
Also keep track of the index where max was found.
