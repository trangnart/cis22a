# 12.35 PRACTICE: Vectors**: Longest sequence
![Difficult]

A common statistic of interest is the longest sequence of some pattern in a list of items.
For example, in football, one may be interested in the longest sequence of consecutive complete passes.
Given a list in which each item is either the letter `I`
(for an incomplete pass) or a number (for a completed pass),
output the length of the longest sequence of complete passes.
The list is preceded by the number of items.

## Input/Output
Input | Output
--- | ---
`8 4 15 9 I 30 2 I 20` | `3`

(because the longest sequence of complete passes is `4 15 9`).

## Hints
* Use two variables, one that keeps track of the current sequence length, and another for the longest sequence length.
* In a for loop that iterates through the vector, if you see an `I`, set the current sequence length to `0`.
* Otherwise, you are in sequence (either at the beginning or later in the sequence), so increment the current sequence length.
* A simple way to compute the longest sequence is to potentially update that variable every time you update the current sequence length.
Check if the current is greater than the longest -- if so, update the longest.
* When done iterating, just output the value of the longest sequence length variable.
