# 12.37 PRACTICE: Functions**: Rideshare pickup time
![Difficult]

Rideshare companies like Uber or Lyft track the `x,y` coordinates of drivers and customers on a map.
If a customer requests a ride, the company's app estimates the minutes until the nearest driver can arrive.
Write a function that, given the `x` and `y` coordinates of a customer and the three nearest drivers, returns the estimated pickup time.
Assume drivers can only drive in the `x` or `y` directions (not diagonal),
and each mile takes 2 minutes to drive. All values are integers.

## Hints
* Break the problem into three parts. In the first part, compute the three distances.
* In the second part, determine the minimum distance. In the third part, compute and return the time.
* Don't forget to use absolute value when computing the `x` distance, and again for the `y` distance, because direction doesn't matter.
You may wish to just write a small absolute value function.
