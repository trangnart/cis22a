# 12.39 PRACTICE: Functions**: Simulating waiting time (fast clerk)
Programs commonly perform simulations of physical scenarios like cars in traffic, or people waiting at stores. A store wants to understand customer waiting time. A list provides the number of customers that arrive every minute for 10 minutes. The program should output the length of the line at each minute, assuming one clerk serves each customer and takes 1 minute to complete service. If the input is 2 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0, the output should be 2 1 0 2 2 1 0 0 1 0 (At minute 0, 2 customers arrived in line. At minute 1, 1 of those has been served, reducing the line to 1. At minute 2, that customer was served, reducing the line to 0). Output a space after each output integer, including the last (followed by newline).

HINTS:
* Every minute, if the lineLength wasn't 0, you can decrement lineLength because the clerk would have finished serving one customer.
* Every minute, if new customers arrived, just add them to lineLength for that minute.
