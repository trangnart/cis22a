# 12.40 PRACTICE: Functions**: Number to words
![Difficult]

Sometimes numbers are converted to words, like in a wedding invitation.
So `23` becomes `twenty three`.

Write a function `DigitToWord` that takes a single digit number from `0-9` and returns that number's word: `0` is zero, `1` is one, `2` is two, etc (if the number is outside `0-9`, return `error`).

Write another function `TensDigitToWord` that takes a single digit number from `2-9`, and returns that number's word when it appears in the tens digit:
`2` is twenty, `3` is thirty, etc.

If the number is outside `2-9`, return `error`.

Finally, write a function `TwoDigitNumToWords` that takes a two-digit number from `20-99` and returns that number in words.
Your main program should get a user's integer,
call `TwoDigitNumToWords`, and output the resulting string.
If the input is `23`, the output should be `twenty three`.

Do not do any error checking of the input.
Note that your program does not support all numbers. `0-19` will yield error output, for example.

## Hints
* Write `DigitToWord` first, and test the function (have your main call that function directly) -- you won't pass any of the tests, but you should still start that way. Next, write `TensDigitToWord` and test it by itself also. Finally, write `TwoDigitNumToWords` (calling your first two functions) and test the entire program.
* Your `TwoDigitNumToWords` function should pass the ten's digit to `TensDigitToWord`. To get the tens digit, divide the number by `10`.
* Your `TwoDigitNumToWords` function should pass the one's digit to `DigitToWord`. To get the ones digit, mod the number by `10` `(num % 10)`.
* You can concatenate the strings returned by those two functions using the `+` operator. Ex: `"hello" + " " + "there"` yields one string `"hello there"`.
