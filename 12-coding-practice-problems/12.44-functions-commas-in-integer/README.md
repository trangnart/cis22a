# 12.44 PRACTICE: Functions***: Commas in integer
![Hard]

Commas make large integers easier to read.
Ex: `145,020` is easier to read than `145020`.
Write a function that takes an integer,
and returns a string representation of that number with commas appropriately inserted.

## Input/Output
Input | Output
--- | ---
`145020` | `145,020`

## Hints
* Develop incrementally: Start by just converting the integer to a string, without commas.
Then update the program to insert commas.
* This problem is hard. Take your time. Do little by little.
* Write a function to convert a single integer digit to a char (`DigitToChar`). Then use that function in your function that converts an integer to a string.
* Insert one digit at a time into the string,
starting with the one's place. Use `% 10` to get the rightmost digit.
Use `/ 10` to shift the number right (discarding the current 1's place).
* Use the string's `insert()` function. Note that insert at the front has a strange syntax. For string str: `str.insert(str.begin(), yourChar)`
